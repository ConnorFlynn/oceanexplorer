The goal of oceanexplorer is to enable easy access and exploration of the [WORLD OCEAN ATLAS](https://www.nodc.noaa.gov/OC5/SELECT/woaselect/woaselect.html) of the US agency [NOAA](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/).

## Check the app

Check the app here: https://utrecht-university.shinyapps.io/oceanexplorer/

## Funding

This project was funded by ERC Starting grant number 802835, OceaNice, awarded to Peter Bijl.

## Credits

The construction of the R [@rversion] package *oceanexplorer* and associated documentation was aided by the packages; *devtools* [@devtools], *roxygen2* [@roxygen2], *testthat* [@testthat], *shinytest* [@shinytest], *vdiffr* [@vdiffr], *knitr* [@knitr2014 ; @knitr2015], *rmarkdown* [@rmarkdown2018; @rmarkdown2020], and the superb guidance in the book: *R packages: organize, test, document, and share your code*, by @Wickham2015. 

Data transformation, cleaning and visualization is performed with: *dplyr* [@dplyr], *ggplot2* [@ggplot2], and *rlang* [@rlang].

In addition, this package relies on a set of packages for spatial data analysis: *sf* [@sf] and *stars* [@stars].

The app is build with *shiny* [@shiny] and the guidance in the book: *Mastering Shiny: Build Interactive Apps, Reports & Dashboards* [@Wickham2020] was a great help in learning how to develop such applications. Furthermore, the packages *shinyjs* [@shinyjs], *waiter* [@waiter], *bslib* [@bslib] and *thematic* [@thematic] ensure user-friendliness of the interface and visually pleasing graphics.


## Installation

You can install the latest version of oceanexplorer from CRAN

``` r
# Install oceanexplorer from CRAN: 
install.packages("oceanexplorer")
```


## Example

The package allows extraction of global databases of several physical and chemical parameters of the ocean from the NOAA WORLD OCEAN ATLAS.

```{r load}
library(oceanexplorer)
# obtain the NOAA world ocean atlas for oxygen content
oxy_global <- get_NOAA("oxygen", 1, "annual")
```


Slice a specific interval from the array with `filter_NOAA()`, like so:

```{r slice}
# filter a depth of 200 meters to show OMZs
(oxy_omz <- filter_NOAA(oxy_global, depth = 200))
```


In addition, the sliced array can be plotted, like so:

```{r plot1}
# plot the NOAA world ocean atlas for oxygen content
plot_NOAA(oxy_omz, depth = NULL)
```

The same plot can be produced by taking the original data and supplying a value to the `depth` argument and specifying the range of oxygen content to `oxy_omz`.


```{r plot2}
# plot the NOAA world ocean atlas for oxygen content
plot_NOAA(oxy_global, depth = 200, rng = range(oxy_omz[[1]]))
```


# Interactive exploration

Lastly, the package can launch a Shiny app for interactive exploration of the datasets.

```{r app, eval = FALSE}
# launch an interactive shiny session
NOAA_app()
```


Or, the RStudio addin can be launched within the RStudio viewer pain by executing the following code, or by using the `Addins` drop down menu in the taskbar.

```{r addin, eval = FALSE}
# launch an interactive shiny session
NOAA_addin()
```
